# Funnel-Analysis-Identifying-83-Drop-from-Visit-to-Add-to-Cart

Objective:
To analyze user behavior across the e-commerce conversion funnel and identify the reasons behind a significant 83% drop-off between the "Visit" and "Add to Cart" stages.

Approach:

Collected and cleaned user interaction data (e.g., page views, clicks, session duration).

Built a funnel using stages: Visit → Product View → Add to Cart → Checkout → Purchase.

Applied clustering to segment users based on interaction patterns.

Used Random Forest to identify the key features contributing to drop-off.

Key Findings:

Major drop (83%) occurred between Visit and Add to Cart.

Important contributing features:

Low scroll depth

Short session duration

Poor engagement with page titles (e.g., irrelevant or misleading content)

Weak performance in specific meal categories
